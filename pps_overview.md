# Overview
{: #overview}

The Private Path solution solves security, privacy and complexity problems for {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} consumers and providers who want to eliminate the risk of exposing their data on the public internet. Providers can offer their services to IBM Cloud customers over Private Path utilizing the IBM Cloud infrastructure. Private Path components are used when connecting to IBM Cloud services, and can now be used for third-party services.

The Private Path solution has the following advantages compared to using public internet for point-to-point connectivity:

- increased security and privacy
- decreased complexity
- point-to-point connectivity

Private Path solution incorporates various products that IBM Cloud customers are already familiar with. For example, Private Path incorporates any or all of Direct Link, Transit Gateway, Load Balancers, and VPE gateways and Private DNS that are configured in a way to ensure that the entire point-to-point data path is private across IBM Cloud.
